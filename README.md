# Simple Candidate Management System
## Requirement 
- node v24+
- npm v11+
- prettier (optional)
## running locally
- in order to run the mock API you simply need to run 
```shell
npm run api
```
- in order to run the project on dev mode
```shell
npm run dev
```

**notes:**
- the `_page` and `_order` queries don't seem to work, maybe they need to be combined with other queries, I couldn't debug it, since this was my first time using.  ***json-server***.
- removed `start` script because of dependency conflict.
